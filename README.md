Title: OTP Verification in Python

**Description:**
The OTP Verification project is an open-source Python application that provides a robust and secure way to implement One-Time Password (OTP) verification functionality. This project leverages Python's capabilities to generate and validate OTPs, enabling developers to easily integrate OTP verification into their applications.

**Key Features:**
1. OTP Generation: The project offers a flexible OTP generation mechanism that supports various algorithms, such as time-based OTP (TOTP) and counter-based OTP (HOTP). Developers can generate OTPs based on their specific requirements.
SMS Delivery: The application includes functionality to send OTPs via SMS. It integrates with popular SMS gateways or APIs, allowing seamless delivery of OTPs to users' mobile devices.
2. Customization Options: Developers have the flexibility to customize the length, expiry time, and format of the OTPs generated. This enables them to tailor the OTP verification process according to their application's needs.
OTP Validation: The project provides a validation mechanism to verify the OTP entered by the user. It checks the correctness and expiration of the OTP, ensuring secure and reliable verification.
3. Error Handling: The application includes comprehensive error handling to handle scenarios such as invalid OTPs, network failures, or SMS delivery issues. This ensures a smooth user experience and robust verification process.
Technical Details:
The OTP Verification project is developed using the Python programming language, making it highly portable and compatible with major operating systems. It utilizes Python libraries for generating OTPs, interacting with SMS gateways or APIs, and handling input validation.

**Contributions:**
Contributors are encouraged to join the project and contribute by adding new OTP generation algorithms, integrating with additional SMS gateways or APIs, improving error handling, or enhancing overall security. Collaboration is welcomed through pull requests, bug reports, and feature requests to further enhance the OTP verification experience.

**Dependencies:**
1. Python 3.x
2. Python libraries for OTP generation (such as pyotp or otpauth)
3. Libraries for SMS gateway integration (such as Twilio or Nexmo) (optional)

**Installation:**
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or any preferred package manager.
3. Configure the SMS gateway credentials or APIs according to the desired SMS delivery method.
4. Integrate the OTP verification module into your application, following the provided documentation and examples.
